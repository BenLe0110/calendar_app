## File Organization Guidelines

1. Keep related functionality together in appropriate directories
2. Follow Flutter's recommended project structure
3. Maintain separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data models
4. Use consistent naming conventions across all files
5. Document complex logic and important functions
6. Keep platform-specific code in dedicated directories

## Best Practices

- Keep widgets modular and reusable
- Implement proper error handling in services
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Follow Flutter's style guide for code formatting
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Maintain platform-specific adaptations
- Follow platform-specific design guidelines
- Use responsive design patterns for different screen sizes

## Database Implementation

### SQLite Structure
- Uses `sqflite` package for database operations
- Implements migrations for schema updates
- Handles platform-specific storage paths
- Implements CRUD operations for all entities

### Data Models
- Clear separation between UI models and database entities
- Proper data validation and type safety
- Efficient data serialization/deserialization
- Platform-specific data handling when needed
